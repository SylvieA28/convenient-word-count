# convenient-word-count
This userscript allows the user to skip the popup when looking at the word count of their document on google docs. The user can either use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + C or navigate to the Word Count dialog through the Tool menu. The word count will immediately appear on the bottom left. Using the shortcut again or clicking on Word Count in the Tool menu will turn it off. 
In order to use the script, download a script manager like Violentmonkey.
